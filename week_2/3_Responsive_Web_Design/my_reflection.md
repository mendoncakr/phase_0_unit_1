# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
-	 Responsive web design is the approach developers take to design websites that are flexible and which optimize viewing for various devices (i.e. tablets, smartphones, laptops, etc.) It's a great practice because it allows for easy navigating and reading of webpages across all devices with less resizing, scrolling, and/or panning.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
- 	Smartphones and tablets have definitely changed the way developers approach web design. Instead of appealing only to desktop/laptop users, they now must appeal, to smaller, narrower, and varied sized screens. 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
- Visually impaired people must browse the web using tools that read aloud the screen. I suppose in terms of design, the visuals aren't quite necessary. We, as developers, should definitely promote the development for the impaired. However, I don't find it to be that big of a concern because the web is mostly a visual experience.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
- I've started checking which websites have responsive design built into them. I was quite surprised to notice that not a lot of sites have responsive design implemented into them.
