My Website url: www.mendoncakr.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I had a great time building my very own website from scratch. I took a simple and clean approach to the page design as I find that that is most representaitve of my own style. I've always been told that just because something is simple does not mean it should lack character or quality and I've always tried to align my work goals towards that saying. To begin, I looked at my wireframe and just started coding from top to bottom. Filling in the gaps as I went along. Something I did and still have problems with was centering images. I found that the internet said to set a margin of 0 for the top and auto for the left/right, but at times that just didn't work. 

I did however learn that when creating a website, we, the developers, must learn to craft the site with the end user in mind. It was actually quite difficult to always keep this in mind as I tend to only think about what I wanted for my site. Some things I'd like to change next are creating a better lay out for the blog. i.e. having the blog page show previews of the blogs and having a "read more" link as opposed to one page with every blog listed in order. How I go about doing that is beyond me at this point. I'd also like to add a more in depth about me page along with a link to my portfolio that I will be creating at DBC and beyond.Finally, I'd also like to have a more interactive photos page. Something that can display the photos in a slideshow format would be interesting.
