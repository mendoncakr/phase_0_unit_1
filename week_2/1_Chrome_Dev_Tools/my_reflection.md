# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
	- The Document Object Model is an application programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It parses the HTML source code and allows scripting langauges such as JavaScript to update the content, structure, and style of documents dynamically. 

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
	- I compared my site to something which was the extreme opposite (www.mariobatali.com). Obviously, my site doesn't even compare as its the epitome of simplicity. On the other hand, it's definitely nice to see the structure of a website such as Mario's that is so full of images, links, divisions, and scripts.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
	- I found it to be quite helpful for the purposes I used it for. I know I still have a long way to go in order to be proficient at it. As I start using it more  and play around with all it's features, I'm confident that I'll get a good understanding of it all.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
	- Yeah, it actually took me sometime to change the :hover color on the quiz because I wasn't including the full nested element.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
