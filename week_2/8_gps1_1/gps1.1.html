<h3>Our take away from pair programming</h3>
<p>Pairing for the first time was fun and difficult at the same time. We enjoyed because it was
    a lot easier when something wasn't working to figure it out what did work. Giving
    each other time and using each other's input to create good working code was definitely a plus, but working
    remotely was a challenge. Overall, it definitely was a good experience to pair program as we learned a lot
    together than we would have by ourselves.
