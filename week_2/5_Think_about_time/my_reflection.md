# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
The biggest time manangement challenge is really just balancing everything. By everything I mean my work, social, and phase 0 lives. Working 8+ hours a day with a 1 hour commute each way is definitely tiresome to say the least. On top of that, coming home, preparing food, and finding a few moments to relax can be a challenge when living with roommates in close quarters. 

* How will you combat that? 
To combat the stress of balancing it all out, I'm going to try to take things slow and steady. I find that I always find myself rushing to do things, which causes me to be stressed out or anxious because it always feels as if there is a looming deadline. 

* What techniques will you try? 
I'm going to try to first take it slow. Instead of rushing, I want to ensure that I do a thorough job and am happy with the end result before submitting anything. I'm also going to try to utilize the pomodorro technique into my work habits during phase 0 and most definitely will try to be a lot more mindful of myself.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
Overall, with week 2 coming to an end tonight and week 3 just over the horizon, I really want to focus on my work and minimize all distractions while doing work for phase 0. (i.e. Facebook, going out, drinking, etc.) I must utilize every minute that I have of phase 0 to maximize my learning in this short period of time.
