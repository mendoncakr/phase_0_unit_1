# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
- I'm always in favor of setting standards across the board. Especially for a topic as broad as the web. It's definitely a good thing for to have technical standards and guidelines because it not only simplifies development but also ensures that pages load the same on different browsers.


* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
- So far yes, they seem pretty straight forward. Although I did have trouble on the practice folder with changing the font to Entypo. I tried all possible paths for the font and it still didn't work.


* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
- I'm quite indifferent to it.The new elements dont make it more or less difficult to type or use as code.


* Why is reset.css necessary?
- reset.css is necessary in order to reduce inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins, font sizes of heading, etc when the pages first loads in a browser.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
-I've pretty much always used Chrome but recently have been using Safari a lot lately. It seems to run significantly faster than Chrome (surprisingly) and has features or gestures that are not available in Chrome. Since I only use 1 browser most of the time now, I don't notice subtle changes in sites that may vary from browser to browser.
