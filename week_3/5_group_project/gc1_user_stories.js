// I want three things that will calculate the following for me if I have a group 
// of numbers in a set. Theres no particular order to this set, just random numbers.
// I want the first thing to be called  "sum" and I want it to  print out the sum of all the numbers 
// in the set. The sum is  defined as the addition of all numbers contained within that set.
// Next, I want the second thing to be called "mean" and it should give me the average of the set.
// By average I mean, the sum divided by the # of items in the set. Finally, I want my third thing to be called "median" 
// and it should give me the middle number within the set. If my set of numbers is even it should give me the average 
// of the two middle numbers. On the other hand, the set contains an odd amount of numbers, it should 
// only give me the middle one.
